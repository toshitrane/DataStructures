* Two types of trees
** Ordered tree:
    Is one in which the children of each node are ordered. (Usually in in a logical order)
** Binary tree
    Ordered tree with all nodes having at most 2 children.


For Complete Binary tree:

* At any given level i iot has 2^i nodes.

* In a tree of height h
** leaves are at level h
** No. of leaves is 2^h
** No. of internal nodes = 2^h -1 i.e (No. of leaves -1)
** Total No. of nodes = 2^(h+1)-1 = n

* In a tree of n nodes
** No. of leaves is (n+1)/2
** Height = log2 (No. of leaves)
